Brave Hearth
============

A chrome extension to directly reward web producers with no trusted intermediaries.

The extension monitors the pages you're visiting and looks for Bitcoin Cash addresses in them. The goal is to provide a summary of the pages, channels, or users from which you consume the most content and allow you to contribute to them proportionally, in an easy way. This is similar to (and inspired by) Brave Rewards but with the difference that:

  * Addresses are collected directly from the pages you visit;
  * Producers don't have to register to any service;
  * It uses Bitcoin Cash;
  * Producers receive 100% of your contribution;
